# Project Charter — Cognitive OS

Significant architectural decisions for the Cognitive OS prototype. Newest first. Each entry
links to the canonical artifact that records the decision in full.

## DD-2026-06-14-B — Adopt the prototype-first engine track (ADR-002 L0–L2), additive

**Decision.** The forward direction is prototype-first: build the minimal deterministic runtime
engine chartered by [ADR-002](../ADR-002-runtime-engine-replay-contract.md) — the L0 kernel, L1
ingress/scheduling/frames, and L2 run/record/replay — then add a replaceable LLM language codec at
the human-language boundary (never inside the kernel). This is the **Prototype-First Track
(P0–P15)** in [a.md](../a.md).

**Additive, not replacing.** The incremental 24i–35 Python-cognition backlog remains the deferred
backlog, still gated by the unified self-correction loop. P0–P15 is the active build order.

**Why.** The v0.1 governance lineage (S24–32) proved the *evidence contract* (ADR-002 L3) that
secures engine changes. The engine those traces describe (L0–L2) is still realized as Python
scripts; the prototype track builds it underneath the L3 guardrail that already governs it.

**Rationale for ADR-002.** It was cited as the "runtime engine replay contract" by
`SPRINT_28/29/30_PLAN.md`, `DESIGN_REVIEW_NOTES.md`, and `a.md` before the charter existed; writing
it resolved that dangling reference and made the L0–L3 layer names authoritative.

## DD-2026-06-14-A — Freeze v0.1 governance milestone as the ADR-002 L3 evidence contract

**Decision.** Sprints 24–32 (derived effect → trace-grounded invariants → content binding → signed
provenance → signer governance → mechanism-source binding) are frozen as the v0.1 governance
milestone. In ADR-002's layer model this lineage **is** L3: the content-bound, signed,
mechanism-bound replay-evidence contract. Recorded in
[GOVERNANCE_MILESTONE.md](../GOVERNANCE_MILESTONE.md) (FROZEN) and
[RELEASE_REVIEW.md](../RELEASE_REVIEW.md).

**Caveats preserved (not hidden).** Single-signer authority, adjudicator-only behavioral probe,
restricted-AST-subset precision, and the who-watches-the-watchmen fixed point remain published
residuals. This is a v0.1 governance proof-of-concept, not production-ready for crypto-critical use
until those are accepted or resolved.
